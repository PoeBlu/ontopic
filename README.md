# ontopic

`ontopic` let's you listen to [SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns) notification from you command line.  
It does so by creating an [SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs) queue subscribed to the topic and polling it.  
You must have your `AWS` account correctly configured on your machine for `ontopic` to work.

WIP.
